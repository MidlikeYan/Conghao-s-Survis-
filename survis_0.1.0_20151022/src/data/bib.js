        "abstract": "Large dynamic networks are targets of analysis in many fields. Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific co-authorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP dataset.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring a computer network's security state is a di cult task as network components rarely share their information. The IF-MAP speci fication de fines a client/server-based protocol that enables network components to share security information among each other, which is represented in a graph structure. Visualization of this data is challenging due to the highly dynamic topology and the mapping of logical nodes onto physical devices. Furthermore, data in a MAP server is volatile and there is no standardized way to preserve and review changes or previous states of a MAP graph. The evolution of such a graph, however, embodies valuable information for the analysis of past incidents and attacks on the network infrastructure. In this paper we introduce a software framework to visualize MAP data and propose a solution for the effi cient long-term storage and replication of MAP graphs. We demonstrate how changes in the graph structure between given points in time can be computed and visualized.",

Our methods are based on the use of network analysis method, and new visualization methods for dynamic graphs with dynamic hierarchy and geographic clustering. More specifically, we derive a dynamic network with geographic clustering from the history of the FIFA World Cup competition data, based on who-beats-whom relationship. Combined with the centrality analysis (which defines dynamic hierarchy) and the use of the union of graphs (which determines the overall layout topology), we present three new visualization methods for dynamic graphs with dynamic hierarchy and geographic clustering: wheel layout, radial layout and hierarchical layout. Our experimental results show that our visual analysis methods can clearly reveal the overall winner of the World Cup competition history as well as the strong and weak countries. Furthermore, one can analyze and compare the performance of each country for each year along the context with their overall performance. This enables us to confirm the expected and discover the unexpected.",

        "abstract": "Scientific articles are the major mechanism for researchers to report their results, and a collection of papers on a discipline can reveal a lot about its evolution, such as the emergence of new topics. Nonetheless, given a broad collection of papers it is typically very difficult to grasp important information that could help readers to globally interpret, navigate and then focus on the relevant items for their task. Content-based document maps are visual representations created from evaluating the (dis)similarity amongst the documents, and have been shown to support exploratory tasks in this scenario. Documents are represented by visual markers placed in the 2D space so that documents close share similar content. Albeit the maps allow visually identifying groups of related documents and frontiers between groups, they do not explicitly convey the temporal evolution of a collection. We propose a technique for creating content-based similarity maps of document collections that highlight temporal changes along time. Our solution constructs a sequence of maps from time-stamped sub-sets of the data. It adopts a cumulative backwards strategy to preserve user context across successive time-stamps, i.e., maps do not change drastically from one time stamp to the next, favouring user perception of changes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of a human-computer interaction experiment that compared the performance of the animation of dynamic graphs to the presentation of small multiples and the effect that mental map preservation had on the two conditions. Questions used in the experiment were selected to test both local and global properties of graph evolution over time. The data sets used in this experiment were derived from standard benchmark data sets of the information visualization community. We found that small multiples gave significantly faster performance than animation overall and for each of our five graph comprehension tasks. In addition, small multiples had significantly more errors than animation for the tasks of determining sets of nodes or edges added to the graph during the same timeslice, although a positive time-error correlation coefficient suggests that, in this case, faster responses did not lead to more errors. This result suggests that, for these two tasks, animation is preferable if accuracy is more important than speed. Preserving the mental map under either the animation or the small multiples condition had little influence in terms of error rate and response time.",

        "abstract": "In dynamic graph drawing, preserving the mental map, or ensuring that the location of nodes do not change significantly as the information evolves over time is considered an important property by algorithm designers. Many prior experiments have attempted to verify this principle, with surprisingly little success. These experiments have used several different algorithmic methods, a variety of graph interpretation questions on both real and fabricated data, and different presentation methods. However, none of the results have conclusively demonstrated the importance of mental map preservation on task performance. Our experiment measures the efficacy of the dynamic graph drawing in a different manner: we look at how memorable the evolving graph is, rather than how easy it is to interpret. As observed in the previous studies, we found no significant difference in terms of response time or error rate when preserving the mental map. While preserving the mental map is a good idea in principle, we find that it may not always support performance. However, our qualitative data suggests that, in terms of the user's perception, preserving the mental map makes memorability tasks easier. Our qualitative data also suggests that there may be two features of the dynamic graph drawing that may assist in their memorability: interesting subgraphs that remain visible over time and interesting patterns in node movement. The former is supported by preserving the mental map while the latter is not.",

To date, no experiment has found conclusive evidence that supports the effectiveness of the mental map in the comprehension of a dynamic graph series.

In a recent experiment, drawing stability (known more widely as the \u201cmental map\u201d) was shown to help users follow specific nodes or long paths in dynamically evolving data. However, no significant difference between animation and small multiples presentations was found.

We then report on a user study, based on representative tasks identified through the taxonomy, and that compares GraphDiaries to existing techniques for temporal navigation in dynamic networks, showing that it outperforms them in terms of both task time and errors for several of these tasks.",

        "abstract": "We review a range of temporal data visualization techniques through a new lens, by describing them as series of operations performed on a conceptual space-time cube. These operations include extracting subparts of a space-time cube, flattening it across space or time, or transforming the cube's geometry or content. We introduce a taxonomy of elementary space-time cube operations, and explain how they can be combined to turn a three-dimensional space-time cube into an easily-readable two-dimensional visualization. Our model captures most visualizations showing two or more data dimensions in addition to time, such as geotemporal visualizations, dynamic networks, time-evolving scatterplots, or videos. We finally review interactive systems that support a range of operations. By introducing this conceptual framework we hope to facilitate the description, criticism and comparison of existing temporal data visualizations, as well as encourage the exploration of new techniques and systems.",

We introduce the Matrix Cube, a novel visual representation and navigation model for dynamic networks, inspired by the way people comprehend and manipulate physical cubes. Users can change their perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3D cube. These manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the Cubix system. We then show how two domain experts, an astronomer and a neurologist, used Cubix to explore and report on their own network data.",

MultiPiles is based on the physical analogy of piling adjacency matrices, each one representing a single temporal snapshot. Common interfaces for visualizing dynamic networks use techniques such as: flipping/animation; small multiples; or summary views in isolation. Our proposed 'piling' metaphor presents a hybrid of these techniques, leveraging each one's advantages, as well as offering the ability to scale to networks with hundreds of temporal snapshots. While the MultiPiles technique is applicable to many domains, our prototype was initially designed to help neuroscientists investigate changes in brain connectivity networks over several hundred snapshots. The piling metaphor and associated interaction and visual encodings allowed neuroscientists to explore their data, prior to a statistical analysis. They detected high-level temporal patterns in individual networks and this helped them to formulate and reject several hypotheses.",

In this paper, we introduce a visualization technique for time-varying graphs that is scalable with respect to the number of time steps.

To illustrate the usefulness of our approach we analyzed method call graphs recorded during the execution of the open source software system JHotDraw. Furthermore, we studied a time-varying social network representing researchers and their dynamic communication structure while attending the ACM Hypertext 2009 conference.",

Visualizations of software history that provide only static views do not capture the dynamic nature of software evolution.

An evolution storyboard consists of a sequence of animated panels, which highlight the structural changes in the system; one panel for each considered time period. Using storyboards, engineers can spot good design, signs of structural decay, or the spread of cross cutting concerns in the code. We implemented our concepts in a tool, which automatically extracts software dependency graphs from version control repositories and computes storyboards based on panels for different time periods. For applying our approach in practice, we provide a step by step guide that others can follow along the storyboard visualizations, in order to study the evolution of large systems. We have applied our method to several large open source software systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that our method provides additional information (compared to static views) on the ArgoUML project, an open source UML modeling tool.",

To achieve this goal we performed a deep analysis of the collected findings, the interaction logs, and the subjective feedback from the users.

With small-multiples more findings concerning longer time periods were made. Besides, our results suggest that switching from one view to the other might lead to an increase in the numbers of findings of specific types made by the subjects which can be beneficial for certain tasks.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic graph layout refers to the layout of graphs that change over time. These changes are due to user interaction, algorithms, or other underlying processes determining the graph. Typically, users spend a noteworthy amount of time to get familiar with a layout, i.e. they build a mental map [ELMS91]. To retain this map at least partially, consecutive layouts of similar graphs should not differ significantly. Still, each of these layouts should adhere to constraints and criteria that have been specified to improve meaning and readability of a drawing. In [BW97], we introduced random field models for graph layout. As a major advantage of this formulation, many different layout models can be represented uniformly by random variables. This uniformity enables us to now present a framework for dynamic layout of arbitrary random field models. Our approach is based on Bayesian decision theory and formalizes common sense procedures. Example applications of our framework are dynamic versions of two well-known layout models: Eades' spring embedder [Ead84], and Tamassia's bend-minimum orthogonal layout model for plane graphs [Tam87].",

We present a system that is able to visualize the evolution of biological networks in many species. We start with providing a comprehensible overview of the entire data set and provide details of the data upon demand via interaction mechanisms to select interesting subsets of the data. The selected subsets can be visualized using two main visualization types: (a) as network alignments in 2.5D (or other known) layouts or (b) as an animation of evolving networks. We developed a graph layout algorithm supporting the comparison of networks across both species and time steps without changing the graph layout while switching between the overview, the animated view, and the alignment view.We evaluate our system by applying it to real-world data.",

The most common metaphor to visualize graphs is the node-link technique, which typically suffers from visual clutter caused by many edge crossings. Much research has been done on the development of sophisticated algorithms aimed at enhancing the layout with respect to edge crossings and a series of other aesthetic criteria. In this paper we propose a novel visual metaphor, called Time-SpiderTrees, which is based on a radial layout. In our technique, relations are visually indicated by orientation instead of connectedness to circumvent the problem of edge crossings. The strength of this novel visualization technique lies in the visual encoding of time-series relational data in a single view without animation, which helps to preserve the mental map and hence to reduce cognitive efforts.",

The graph edges are layered around thumbnail wheels consisting of color-coded sectors that are representatives of the graph nodes. These sectors generate implicit representations of graph edges. Start and target vertices are perceived by inspecting the color coding of sectors in the context of other sectors and their orientations. The technique puts emphasis on newer relations and hence, these are mapped to a larger display space in the radial diagram. The benefit of our technique is reduction of visual clutter from which node-link diagrams typically suffer. The visualization focuses on an easy exploration of trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in time-varying relational data.

Graph edges are displayed as curved lines starting from a source on the inner borderline of the ring and pointing to a target on the outer borderline. To better perceive link directions and structures of large datasets, visual clutter is reduced by exploiting an edge splatting approach that generates density fields of the displayed edges. The radial layout emphasizes newer graphs, displayed in the larger, outer parts of the circle. As a benefit, edge lengths are reduced in comparison to the non-radial visualization. Moreover, the radial layout guarantees the symmetry of the visualization under shifting of vertices.

        "abstract": "During eye tracking studies, vast amounts of spatio-temporal data in the form of eye gaze trajectories are recorded. Finding insights into these time-varying data sets is a challenging task. Visualization techniques such as heat maps or gaze plots help find patterns in the data but either highly aggregate the data (heat maps) or are difficult to read due to overplotting (gaze plots). In this paper, we propose transforming eye movement data into a dynamic graph data structure to explore the visualization problem from a new perspective. By aggregating gaze trajectories of participants over time periods or Areas of Interest (AOIs), a fair trade-off between aggregation and details is achieved. We show that existing dynamic graph visualizations can be used to display the transformed data and illustrate the approach by applying it to eye tracking data recorded for investigating the readability of tree diagrams.",

Edges between vertices are represented as stacked horizontal and color-coded links starting and ending at their corresponding start and end vertex positions. The direction of each edge is indicated by placing it either above or below the horizontal vertex line. We attach a vertically aligned timeline to each link to show the weight evolution for those links. The order of the vertices and stacked edges is important for the readability of the visualization. We support interactive reordering and sorting in the vertex, edge, and timeline representations.

        "abstract": "Network evolution is an ubiquitous phenomenon in a wide variety of complex systems. There is an increasing interest in statistically modeling the evolution of complex networks such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. In this article, we address a practical issue concerning the visualizations of co-citation networks of scientific publications derived by two widely known link reduction algorithms, namely minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and pathfinder networks (PFNETs). Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of critical paths into account.",

        "abstract": "This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature\u2014an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981\u20132004) and terrorism (1990\u20132003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.",

One of their major characteristics is the emergence of some global properties stemmed from local interactions between the entities themselves and between the entities and the environment. The structure of these systems as sets of interacting entities leads researchers to model them as graphs. However, their understanding requires most often to consider the dynamics of their evolution. It is indeed not relevant to study some properties out of any temporal consideration. Thus, dynamic graphs seem to be a very suitable model for investigating the emergence and the conservation of some properties. GraphStream is a Java-based library whose main purpose is to help researchers and developers in their daily tasks of dynamic problem modeling and of classical graph management tasks: creation, processing, display, etc. It may also be used, and is indeed already used, for teaching purpose.

Using this method, individual processes are displayed as partitioned polygons with color-coded segments showing dependencies to other processes. The entire visualization is also animated to communicate the dynamic execution of the system to the user. The results from a comparative user study of the method show that the Growing Polygons technique is significantly more efficient than the traditional Hasse diagram visualization for analysis tasks related to deducing information flow in a system for both small and large executions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the correctness when solving causality tasks is significantly improved using our method. In addition, the subjective ratings of the users rank the method as superior in all regards, including usability, efficiency, and enjoyability.",

        "abstract": "Applying visual analytics to large software systems can help users comprehend the wealth of information produced by source repository mining. One concept of interest is the co-evolution of test code with source code, or how source and test files develop together over time. For example, understanding how the testing pace compares to the development pace can help test managers gauge the effectiveness of their testing strategy. A useful concept that has yet to be effectively incorporated into a co-evolution visualization is co-change. Co-change is a quantity that identifies correlations between software artifacts, and we propose using this to organize our visualization in order to enrich the analysis of co-evolution. In this paper, we create, implement, and study an interactive visual analytics tool that displays source and test file changes over time (co-evolution) while grouping files that change together (co-change). Our new technique improves the analyst\u2019s ability to infer information about the software development process and its relationship to testing. We discuss the development of our system and the results of a small pilot study with three participants. Our findings show that our visualization can lead to inferences that are not easily made using other techniques alone.",

We use a novel technique for visualization of large graphs that evolve through time. Given a dynamic graph, the layout algorithm produces two-dimensional representations of each timeslice, while preserving the mental map of the graph from one slice to the next.

However, the need to draw evolving or dynamic graphs has brought into question many of the assumptions, conventions and layout methods designed to date. For example, social scientists studying evolving social networks have created a demand for visual representations of graphs changing over time. Two common approaches to represent temporal information in graphs include animation of the network and use of static snapshots of the network at different points in time. Here, we report on two experiments, one in a laboratory environment and another using an asynchronous remote web-based platform, Mechanical Turk, to compare the efficiency of animated displays versus static displays. Four tasks are studied with each visual representation, where two characterise overview level information presentation, and two characterise micro level analytical tasks. For the tasks studied in these experiments and within the limits of the experimental system, the results of this study indicate that static representations are generally more effective particularly in terms of time performance, when compared to fully animated movie representations of dynamic networks.",

In this study, we diverge from this traditional layout approach and develop a layout for ego networks that places the time dimension in the foreground, by turning time into an element of shape. In addition to this we develop an interactive system that enables the visualisation of multiple networks simultaneously by employing small multiples. Using the proposed layout and analytical system as a grounding visual structure, we visually characterise dynamic network events in 3 different networks; the evolution of the biotechnology field, a phone call data set and a network of passenger connections of an airline. From this analysis we propose a range of ego network visual motifs that can be used as templates to identify and characterise events that are occurring in a dynamic network.",

Our approach utilizes existing graph layout algorithms to produce the initial graph layout, and formulates the problem of generating coherent time-varying graph visualization with the focus+context capability as a specially tailored deformation optimization problem. We adopt the concept of the super graph to maintain spatiotemporal coherence and further balance the needs for aesthetic quality and dynamic stability when interacting with time-varying graphs through focus+context visualization. Our method is particularly useful for multifocus+context visualization of time-varying graphs where we can preserve the mental map by preventing nodes in the focus from undergoing abrupt changes in size and location in the time sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method strikes a good balance between maintaining spatiotemporal coherence and accentuating visual foci, thus providing a more engaging viewing experience for the users.",

Despite its intuitiveness, the effectiveness of animation in node-link diagrams has been questioned, and several empirical studies have shown that animation is not necessarily superior to static visualizations. However, the exact mechanics of perceiving animated node-link diagrams are still unclear. In this paper, we study the impact of different dynamic graph metrics on user perception of the animation. After deriving candidate visual graph metrics, we perform an exploratory user study where participants are asked to reconstruct the event sequence in animated node-link diagrams. Based on these findings, we conduct a second user study where we investigate the most important visual metrics in depth. Our findings show that node speed and target separation are prominent visual metrics to predict the performance of event sequencing tasks.",

Social networks also exhibit dynamic nature as these networks change continuously with the passage of time. Social networks might also present a hierarchical structure led by individuals who play important roles in a society such as managers and decision makers. Detection and visualization of these networks that are changing over time is a challenging problem where communities change as a function of events taking place in the society and the role people play in it. In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a system to analyze dynamic social networks. The proposed system is based on dynamic graph discretization and graph clustering. The system allows detection of major structural changes taking place in social communities over time and reveals hierarchies by identifying influential people in social networks. We use two different data sets for the empirical evaluation and observe that our system helps to discover interesting facts about the social and hierarchical structures present in these social networks.",

Filtering or compression techniques are often applied to reduce the volume of data without loss of key information vital for a specific analysis goal. Alternatively, visualization is generally accepted as a means of effectively representing large amounts of data. The challenge lies in creating effective and expressive visual representations that not only allows for a global picture, but also enables us to inspect the details of the large data sets. We define the focus of our analysis to be the runtime behavior of features. Static structural visualizations of a system are typically represented in two dimensions. We exploit a third dimension to visually represent the dynamic information, namely object instantiations and message sends. We introduce a novel 3D visualization technique that supports animation of feature behavior and integrates zooming, panning, rotating and on-demand details. As proof of concept, we apply our visualization technique to feature execution traces of an example system.",

Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map. We illustrate the usefulness of the tool by looking at the particular problem of how shortest paths evolve over time. To this end, we applied the system to an evolving graph representing the German Autobahn and its traffic jams.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of large dynamic networks poses a challenge in many fields, ranging from large bot-nets to social networks. As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.",

This report builds on existing graph visualization surveys for the four common facets of partitions, attributes, time, and space. It contributes a generic high-level categorization of faceted graph visualization that subsumes the existing classifications, which can be understood as facet-specific refinements of the resulting categories. Furthermore, it extends beyond existing surveys by applying the same categorization to graph visualizations with multiple facets.

Two orthogonal axes are used: one for all nodes of the displayed graph, the other for the corresponding links. Colors and labels are employed to identify the nodes. The usage of color allows us to scale the visualization to single pixel level for large graphs. In contrast to other techniques, we employ an asymmetric mapping that results in an aligned and compact representation of links. Our approach is independent of the specific properties of the graph to be visualized, but certain graphs and tasks benefit from the asymmetry. As we show in our results, the strength of our technique is the visualization of dynamic graphs. In particular, sparse graphs benefit from the compact representation. Furthermore, our approach uses visual encoding by size to represent weights and therefore allows easy quantification and comparison. We evaluate our approach in a quantitative user study that confirms the suitability for dynamic and weighted graphs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach for two examples of dynamic graphs.",

In the case where we are considering multiple relationships, e.g., different similarity metrics, we also provide an interactive tool to visually explore the effect of combining two or more such relationships.

The purpose of our framework is to enable users to examine the evolution of Web graphs by comparing multiple graphs that have different timings and topics. To achieve this, we provide TimeSlices that are 2D planes to visualize Web graphs in a 3D environment. Users can interactively add new TimeSlices along the timeline, and they can manipulate them to animate Web graphs. Visualized Web graphs on TimeSlices are snapshots of different timings. Moreover, we provide mechanisms to generate and manipulate overlay views and parallel views in the 3D environment to enable Web graphs to be compared. Users can seamlessly change these viewing modes. Our system can also visualize two Web graphs created from different keywords to display the evolutional correlation between them. This system enables us to observe structural and temporal changes in multiple Web graphs such as shifts in influential blogs or power shifts in the diffusion of blogs between topics.",

They are considered to provide valuable information from the viewpoints of sociology, linguistics, and marketing. This paper proposes a novel system for analyzing temporal changes in the activities and interests of bloggers through a 3D visualization of phrase dependency structures in sentences. We first extract events that represent bloggers' activities and interests through analyzing the phrase dependencies of sentences in a blog archive. We roughly categorize the retrieved events according to the thematic roles (such as the experiencer, agent, and location) of the noun within the events, and then store them in a dependency database so that we can retrieve events that involve a given topic. Second, we present a 3D visualization framework for exploring temporal changes in events related to a topic. Our framework enables users to find events about a topic that appear within a specific timing, and drill down details of the events. It also enables users to compare events with different timings and/or on multiple topics. Moreover, it allows them to observe an overview of temporal changes in sets of events, and long-term changes in the frequency of events to assist users in finding trends. We implement the proposed system on our own five-year blog archive that focused on Japanese, and we report the usefulness of our system by using various examples.",

However, it remains largely unexplored how to transform a biochemical model expressed in the stochastic \u03c0-calculus back into a set of meaningful reactions. To this end, we present a two step approach of first translating model states to reaction sets and then visualizing sequences of reaction sets, which are obtained from state trajectories, in terms of reaction networks. Our translation from model states to reaction sets is formally defined and shown to be correct, in the sense that it reflects the states and transitions as they are derived from the continuous time Markov chain-semantics of the stochastic \u03c0-calculus. Our visualization concept combines high level measures of network complexity with interactive, table-based network visualizations. It directly reflects the structures introduced in the first step and allows modelers to explore the resulting simulation traces by providing both: an overview of a network\u2019s evolution and a detail inspection on demand.",

Unlike most network visualization tools, which show the group structure within an entire network, or the group membership for a single actor, C-Group allows users to focus their analysis on a pair of individuals. While C-Group allows for viewing the addition and deletion of nodes (actors) and edges (relationships) over time, its major contribution is its focus on changing group memberships over time. By doing so, users can investigate the context of temporal group memberships for the pair. C-Group provides users with a flexible interface for defining (and redefining) groups interactively, and supports two novel visual representations of the evolving group memberships. This flexibility gives users alternate views that are appropriate for different network sizes and provides users with different insights into the grouping behavior. We demonstrate the utility of the tool on a scientific publication network.",

However, for realistic subject software systems, there are far too many nodes and edges in the displayed graphs to be comprehensible to an end user. Further, for presentation of dynamics, continual change and redisplay of such large graphs is too demanding for conventional workstation computational resources. This paper poses the problem of \u201creduction\u201d or \u201cabstraction\u201d in dynamically changing graphs, and proposes a combination of techniques that can be used to reduce the visual complexity of a graph, without obscuring the significant information that it was meant to convey. The abstract graph can be comprehended more readily and it changes far less frequently than the full graph. As well, when the abstract graph does change, it requires far less computation for layout and redisplay. These abstraction techniques are illustrated by way of examples showing their use in systems for visualization of object-oriented and multi-layer software systems.",

The higher-level structure of the graph is a true tree with meta-nodes of variable size that contain each biconnected component. That tree is drawn with a new area-aware variant of a tree drawing algorithm that handles high-degree nodes gracefully, at the cost of allowing edge-node overlaps.

It is important to be able to identify and diagnose any problems occurring in Internet routing. However, the Internet's sheer size makes this task difficult. One cannot easily extract out the most important or relevant routing information from the large amounts of data collected from multiple routers. To tackle this problem, we have developed Link-Rank, a tool to visualize Internet routing changes at the global scale. Link-Rank weighs links in a topological graph by the number of routes carried over each link and visually captures changes in link weights in the form of a topological graph with adjustable size. Using Link-Rank, network operators can easily observe important routing changes from massive amounts of routing data, discover otherwise unnoticed routing problems, understand the impact of topological events, and infer root causes of observed routing changes.",

        "abstract": "Information visualization has attracted much attention in recent years in many fields of science and engineering. In many applications, graphs are 'dynamic' in the sense that changes are constantly applied to a graph to reflect the evolution of the system behaviour represented by the graph. In the past, the concept of the so-called \"mental map\" has largely been ignored. Users often have to spend a lot of time relearning the redrawn graphs. This paper proposes an effective way to release the user from such kind of a distasteful job by maintaining a high degree of the \"mental map\" for general graphs when graphs are redrawn. Our experimental results suggest this new approach to be promising.",

        "abstract": "As a novel type of real-time social networking service, microblogging has already become ubiquitous and an irreplaceable tool. Tracking in the pulse of retweeting propagation is important and meaningful. In this paper, we investigate how information propagation in a specific microblogging platform evolves to identify relevant patterns and understand dynamic attributes of information propagation and the underlying sociological motivations. More specifically, based on the node-link diagram, we propose three efficient strategies to map the multiple attributes of information propagation graph to appropriate visual elements. For revealing the dynamic attributes, we propose two models: the depth-varying and the time-varying parallel data model to illustrate the temporal evolution efficiently. We also present a novel method by combining the traditional scatter plot with Hough transformation to represent the distribution of propagation instances and trace the propagation speeds. We integrate our methods to a visual mining tool and develop several interactive features. We demonstrate how our approaches improve the understanding of the propagation graph from a visual perspective by employing propagation datasets collected from Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service provider in mainland China. Meanwhile, this visual mining tool has been evaluated by data analysts and successfully used in Sina Corporation as a helpful assistant to them.",

        "abstract": "The amount of information flowing across communication networks has rapidly increased. The highly dynamic and complex networks, represented as large graphs, make the analysis of such networks increasingly challenging. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of several useful visualization techniques for the analysis of spatiotemporal anomalies in large-scale networks. We make use of community-based similarity graphs (CSGs), temporal expansion model graphs (TEMGs), correlation graphs (CGs), high-dimension projection graphs (HDPGs), and topology-preserving compressed graphs (TPCGs). CSG is used to detect anomalies based on community membership changes rather than individual nodes and edges and therefore may be more tolerant to the highly dynamic nature of large networks. TEMG transforms network topologies into directed trees so that efficient search is more likely to be performed for anomalous changes in network behavior and routing topology in large dynamic networks. CG and HDPG are used to examine the complex relationship of data dimensions among graph nodes through transformation in a high-dimensional space. TPCG groups nodes with similar neighbor sets into mega-nodes, thus making graph visualization and analysis more scalable to large networks. All the methods target efficient large-graph anomaly visualization from different perspectives and together provide valuable insights.",

We introduce an exploratory analytical framework, ContexTour, which generates visual representations for exploring multiple dimensions of community activities, including relevant topics, representative users and the community-generated content, as well as their evolutions. ContexTour consists of two novel and complementary components: (1) Dynamic Relational Clustering (DRC) that efficiently tracks the community evolution and smoothly adapts to the community changes, and (2) Dynamic Network Contour-map (DNC) that visualizes the community activities and evolutions in various dimensions. In our experiments, we demonstrate ContexTour through case studies on the DBLP dataset. The visual results capture interesting and reasonable evolution in Computer Science research communities. Quantitatively, we show 85-165X performance gain of our DRC algorithm over the baseline method.",

In this context, we propose a graph-morphing algorithm in order to highlight major tendencies and significant data changes during different periods of time. The goal is to present an animation based on a graph of temporal data, with every period pooled, followed up by each period graph successively. Our approach is based on a space-time analogy like for a clock. For each period, we propose to design a temporal mark, represented in a chronological order in the extremities of the visualization frame, like the hours on a clock. Each element of data is placed near the temporal marks according to its presence during each period. Thus, visualization of the successive periods makes it possible to detect persisting or temporary data and to detect a chronology in the changes in relations.",

        "abstract": "Many models in software and information engineering use graph representations; examples are data flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, flow charts, PERT charts, organization charts, Petri nets and entity-relationship diagrams. The usefulness of these graph representations depends on the quality of the layout of the graphs. Automatic graph layout, which can release humans from graph drawing, is now available in several visualization systems. Most automatic layout facilities take a purely combinatorial description of a graph and produce a layout of the graph; these methods are called 'layout creation' methods. For interactive systems, another kind of layout is needed: a facility which can adjust a layout after a change is made by the user or by the application. Although layout adjustment is essential in interactive systems, most existing layout algorithms are designed for layout creation. The use of a layout creation method for layout adjustment may totally rearrange the layout and thus destroy the user's 'mental map' of the diagram; thus a set of layout adjustment methods, separate from layout creation methods, is needed. This paper discusses some layout adjustment methods and the preservation of the 'mental map' of the diagram. First, several models are proposed to make the concept of 'mental map' more precise. Then two kinds of layout adjustments are described. One is an algorithm for rearranging a diagram to avoid overlapping nodes, and the other is a method aimed at changing the focus of interest of the user without destroying the mental map. Next, some experience with visualization systems in which the techniques have been employed is also described.",

The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.",

Drawings of these structures, as node and link diagrams, can provide a useful visualization of the underlying abstract data. This makes drawings of graphs a useful tool in information visualization. Indeed graph drawing has been applied in many application areas including software engineering, knowledge management and for depicting communication networks. The spatial layout can help the user build up a cognitive model or 'mental map' of the information structure. Many automatic algorithms for producing drawings of a graph have been implemented. In many domains it is also common for the underlying information to be dynamic and this means the graph drawing must be updated. Unfortunately, even small changes to the underlying data can result in dramatic changes to the final drawing and this means the user may totally lose their previous 'mental map'. Animation between the two versions of the layout is one approach that can assist the user to make the transition between the two drawings. We have been examining how to apply the Gestalt principles of organisation to this animation phase. The aim is to assist the user in understanding the structural and visual changes that have occurred in the layout. Results of that work are described with relevant examples.",

In this paper we explore means to show the relationships between the characters of a plot and at the same time their development over the course of a novel. Based on a careful exploration of the design space, we suggest a new visualization technique called Fingerprint Matrices.

For example, extracting connected data from a normalized relational database requires knowledge of the table structure which might not be available for the casual user. In this paper we present a visualization framework which presents the collection as a set of entities and relations (on the data level). Using rating functions, we divide large relation networks into small graphs which resemble ego-centered networks. These graphs are connected so the user can browse from one to another. To further assist the user, we present two views which embed information on the evolution of the relations into the graphs. Each view emphasizes another aspect of temporal development. The framework can be adapted to any repository by a flexible data interface and a graph configuration file. We present some first web-based applications including a visualization of the DBLP data set. We use the DBLP visualization to evaluate our approach.",

Previous work has experimentally compared animation, small multiples, and other techniques, and found trade-offs between these. One potential way to avoid such trade-offs is to combine previous techniques in a hybrid visualization. We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non-hybrid techniques in certain cases.",

Our generic visualization supports dynamic and weighted digraphs and is applied in the context of software evolution.

Central to each algorithm is the \"mental map\": the degree to which the layout supports continuous understanding. This work aims to evaluate the importance of the mental map, alongside traditional static graph aesthetics, in answering questions about dynamic graphs.

The first view is an overview that shows how clusters evolve over time and provides an interface to find and select interesting time-steps. The second view consists of a node link diagram of a selected time-step which uses the clustering to efficiently define the layout. By using the time-dependant clustering, we ensure the stability of our visualization and preserve user mental map by minimizing node motion, while simultaneously producing an ideal layout for each time step.

Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users' performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time.",

Partial link drawings have been introduced for node-link diagrams aiming at reducing visual clutter caused by link crossings. Although this concept was shown to perform well for some parameter settings, it has not been used for visually encoding dynamic weighted digraphs. In this paper we investigate the problem of visualizing time-varying graphs as one node-link diagram in a specific layout by exploiting the links as timelines. Partially drawn links are used to show the graph dynamics by splitting each link into as many segments as time steps have to be represented. Conventional 2D layout algorithms can be applied while simultaneously showing the evolution over time. Color-coded links represent the changing weights. We use tapered links to reduce possible overlaps at the link target nodes that would occur when using traditional arrow-based directed links. We experiment with different graph layouts and different numbers of data dimensions, i.e. number of vertices, edges, and time steps. We illustrate the usefulness of the technique in a case study investigating dynamic migration data.",

The navigation of the entire network is achieved by switching the focus node with user interactions. With this approach, the complexity of the compressed dynamic network is greatly reduced without sacrificing the network and time affinity central to the focus node. As a result, we are able to present each dynamic ego network in a single static view, well supporting user analysis on temporal network patterns. We describe our general framework including the network data pre-processing, 1.5D network and trend visualization design, layout algorithms, as well as several customized interactions. In addition, we show that our approach can also be extended to visualize the event-based and multimodal dynamic networks.

In our design, the egocentric dynamic network is presented in a single static view, supporting rich analysis through user interactions on both time and network. We propose a general framework for the 1.5D visualization approach, including the data processing pipeline, the visualization algorithm design, and customized interaction methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on egocentric dynamic network analysis tasks, through case studies and a controlled user experiment comparing with three baseline dynamic network visualization methods.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the analysis of dynamic network data has become an increasingly prominent research issue. While several visual analytics techniques with the focus on the examination of temporal evolving networks have been proposed in recent years, their effectiveness and utility for end users need to be further analyzed. When dealing with techniques for dynamic network analysis, which integrate visual, computational, and interactive components, users become easily overwhelmed by the amount of information displayed\u2014even in case of small sized networks. Therefore we evaluated visual analytics techniques for dynamic networks during their development, performing intermediate evaluations by means of mock-up and eye-tracking studies and a final evaluation of the running interactive prototype, traceing three pathways of development in detail: The first one focused on the maintenance of the user\u2019s mental map throughout changes of network structure over time, changes caused by user interactions, and changes of analytical perspectives. The second one addresses the avoidance of visual clutter, or at least its moderation. The third pathway of development follows the implications of unexpected user behaviour and multiple problem solving processes. Aside from presenting solutions based on the outcomes of our evaluation, we discuss open and upcoming problems and set out new research questions.",

Commonly semantic relations in timeline visualizations are depicted by interconnecting entities with a directed edge. However it is possible that semantic relations change in the course of time. In this paper we introduce a new timeline visualization for time-dependent semantics called SemaTime that offers a hierarchical categorization of time-dependent entities including navigation and filtering features. We also present a novel concept for visualizing time-dependent relations that allows the illustration of time-varying semantic relations and affords an easy understandable visualization of complex, time-dependent interrelations.",

WebRelievo aligns these graphs according to their time, and automatically determines their layout keeping positions of nodes synchronized over time, so that the user can keep track pages and clusters. This visualization enables us to understand when pages appeared, how their relationships have evolved, and how clusters are merged and split over time. Current implementation of WebRelievo is based on six Japanese web archives crawled from 1999 to 2003. The user can interactively browse those graphs by changing the focused page and by changing layouts of graphs. Using WebRelievo we can answer historical questions, and to investigate changes in trends on the Web. We show the feasibility of WebRelievo by applying it to tracking trends in P2P systems and search engines for mobile phones, and to investigating link spamming.",

To meet this need of increased manageability, this contribution introduces a Social Network Intelligence software approach which aims at supporting the comprehension of the structure and value of electronic communities by automatically extracting and mining available electronic data of various types of virtual communication networks, like e-mail archives, discussion groups, or instant messaging communication. Experimental structural visualizations employing Social Network Analysis methods are combined with Keyword Extraction to move towards a Social Network Intelligence approach which generates transparency of complex virtual communication networks. Together with a comprehensive visualization method, an approach for software-supported communication network measurement and evaluation is suggested. It supports the identification of important participants, topics, or clusters in the network, evaluates the interpersonal communication structure and visually traces the evolvement of the knowledge exchange over time.",

The exploration of time-varying relational data is facilitated by aligning graph patterns radially. Furthermore, our approach incorporates several interaction techniques to explore dynamic patterns such as trends and countertrends.

        "abstract": "Background Mathematical models are nowadays widely used to describe biochemical reaction networks. One of the main reasons for this is that models facilitate the integration of a multitude of different data and data types using parameter estimation. Thereby, models allow for a holistic understanding of biological processes. However, due to measurement noise and the limited amount of data, uncertainties in the model parameters should be considered when conclusions are drawn from estimated model attributes, such as reaction fluxes or transient dynamics of biological species. We developed the visual analytics system iVUN that supports uncertainty-aware analysis of static and dynamic attributes of biochemical reaction networks modeled by ordinary differential equations. The multivariate graph of the network is visualized as a node-link diagram, and statistics of the attributes are mapped to the color of nodes and links of the graph. In addition, the graph view is linked with several views, such as line plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, to support locating uncertainties and the analysis of their time dependencies. As demonstration, we use iVUN to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of a model for Epo-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Our case study showed that iVUN can be used to perform an in-depth study of biochemical reaction networks, including attribute uncertainties, correlations between these attributes and their uncertainties as well as the attribute dynamics. In particular, the linking of different visualization options turned out to be highly beneficial for the complex analysis tasks that come with the biological systems as presented here.",

In real-world systems, the graph topology is oftentimes not static but changes over time and hence, also the community structure changes. Previous timeline-based approaches either visualize the dynamic graph or the dynamic community structure. In contrast, our approach combines both in a single image and therefore allows users to investigate the community structure together with the underlying dynamic graph. Our optimized ordering of vertices and selection of colors in combination with interactive highlighting techniques increases the traceability of communities along the time axis. Users can identify visual signatures, estimate the reliability of the derived community structure, and investigate whether community evolution interacts with changes in the graph topology. The utility of our approach is demonstrated in two application examples.",

A particular focus is the explicit visual encoding of groups, rather than only using graph layout to implicitly indicate groups. We introduce a taxonomy of visualization techniques structuring the field into four main categories: visual node attributes vary properties of the node representation to encode the grouping, juxtaposed approaches use two separate visualizations, superimposed techniques work with two aligned visual layers, and embedded visualizations tightly integrate group and graph representation. We discuss results from evaluations of those techniques as well as main areas of application.

Integration of these two levels of cellular processes is necessary, since it provides the link between the measurements at the transcriptional level (gene expression levels approximated from microarray data) and the phenotype (the observable characteristics of an organism) at the functional and behavioral level. The integration requires visualization approaches besides traditional clustering and statistical analysis methods. Our application can (i) visualize the data from time series experiments in the context of a regulatory network and KEGG metabolic pathways; (ii) identify and visualize active regulatory subnetworks from the gene expression data; (iii) perform a statistical test to identify and subsequently visualize pathways that are affected by differentially expressed genes.

The visual front-end provides features that are specifically useful in the analysis of interaction networks, capturing the dynamic nature of both individual entities as well as interactions among them. The tool provides the user with the option of selecting multiple views, designed to capture different aspects of the evolving graph from the perspective of a node, a community or a subset of nodes of interest. Standard visual templates and cues are used to highlight critical changes that have occurred during the evolution of the network. A key challenge we address in this work is that of scalability - handling large graphs both in terms of the efficiency of the back-end, and in terms of the efficiency of the visual layout and rendering. Two case studies based on bibliometric and Wikipedia data are presented to demonstrate the utility of the toolkit for visual knowledge discovery.",

        "abstract": "We present a new system for visualizing and merging differences in diagrams that uses animation, dual views, a storyboard, relative re-layout, and layering. We ran two user studies investigating the benefits of the system. The first user study compared pairs of hierarchical diagrams with matching node positions. The results underscore that na\u00efve dual-view visualization is undesirable. On the positive side, participants particularly liked the dual-view with difference layer technique. The second user study focused on diagrams with partially varying node positions and difference visualization and animation. We found evidence that both techniques are beneficial, and that the combination was preferred.",

        "abstract": "Networks are present in many fields such as finance, sociology, and transportation. Often these networks are dynamic: they have a structural as well as a temporal aspect. In addition to relations occurring over time, node information is frequently present such as hierarchical structure or time-series data. We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View (MSV) for the analysis of temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as Gestalt principles in the visualization such as closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the MSV to make these features stand out that optionally take the hierarchical node structure into account. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We introduce the circular MSV that further reduces visual clutter. In addition, the (circular) MSV is extended to also convey time-series data associated with the nodes. This enables users to analyze complex correlations between edge occurrence and node attribute changes. We show the effectiveness of the reordering methods on both synthetic and a rich real-world dynamic network data set.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand, and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques were presented by Herman et al. [HMM00] and Diaz [DPS02]. The first work surveyed the main techniques for visualization of hierarchies and graphs in general that had been introduced until 2000. The second work concentrated on graph layouts introduced until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time-varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph-structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review firstly considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process.",

        "abstract": "Contagion is a process whereby the collapse of a node in a network leads to the collapse of neighboring nodes and thereby sets off a chain reaction in the network. It thus creates a special type of time-dependent network. Such processes are studied in various applications, for example, in financial network analysis, infection diffusion prediction, supply-chain management, or gene regulation. Visual analytics methods can help analysts examine contagion effects. For this purpose, network visualizations need to be complemented with specific features to illustrate the contagion process. Moreover, new visual analysis techniques for comparison of contagion need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a system geared to the visual analysis of contagion. It includes the simulation of contagion effects as well as their visual exploration. We present new tools able to compare the evolution of the different contagion processes. In this way, propagation of disturbances can be effectively analyzed. We focus on financial networks; however, our system can be applied to other use cases as well.",
